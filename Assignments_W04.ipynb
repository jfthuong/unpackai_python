    "1. Write a function that gets a directory name, and returns a dict whose keys are the file extensions (i.e., the stuff at the end, like `.txt` or `.jpg`, but following the dot) and whose values are the number of files with such an extension. You‚Äôll likely want to use `os.listdir` or `glob.glob`, which work a bit differently; the first is easier to use, if you‚Äôre not sure!  ... \\[ADDED BY JEFF\\] You can also use `Path().glob` in `pathlib`: see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `random` module includes a function, `random.choice`, that can return a random element from any sequence (including a string). Write a function that takes a list, chooses a random element from it, and then asks the user to repeatedly guess which element has been chosen. When the user guesses correctly, the function returns the number of guesses it took.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \\[OPTIONAL\\] This is a bit harder, but worth trying a bit: The `pickle` module lets you turn data structures into bytestrings _\\[JEFF: basically it is a file that cannot be understood by human, only by machines\\]_, and back. That‚Äôs normally used for storing data on disk and then retrieving it later. You take a data structure and turn it into a bytestring with `pickle.dumps`, which returns a bytestring. You can then take a bytestring and turn it back into data with `pickle.loads`. Create a `dict` in which the keys are strings and the values are integers, strings, or lists (not too many). Use `pickle.dumps` to turn it into a bytestring. Then turn it back into a data structure‚Ä¶ are they the same?\n",
